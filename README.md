On March 26 Roblox [Announced](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/deprecating-comments-for-marketplace-items/2890881) that they were deprecating comments for marketplace items.

They stated the reason for doing so is that
> It has become evident that the comments feature for Marketplace items is no longer serving its original purpose as itâ€™s become a hub for spam, leading to low usage among both users and creators.

The problem is that they are compleately removing them w/ no other way to view them on April 9th
> they will remain in a read-only state until April 9, when we will remove comments entirely.

## Requirements
+ Python 3.9 or higher.
+ Requests

Python can be downloaded [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and Requests can be installed afterwards by running
